The idea is to create a dnd themed mad lib with a random story generator. The story will be divided into randomly generated sections and the user will have to insert the mad lib words before generating the story.

story
villain
ally
encounter
tricks
traps
resolution

we could have a basic setup with random bits thrown in.
For instance
Our hero <noun> <adjective> through the <random bit> and discovers a <random bit>.
Suddenly <random bit>.

it will be more complicated than it needs to be but arguably a lot more fun.



Here is text to start with:

It was the legendary Beast Name! 
Local legends have told about this mighty creature. 
It bared its fangs and rushed our Hero. 
Our Hero was brave. 
Hero brandished his weapon and charged at the creature.
The fowl beast was vanquished.
The Hero arrived at his town to grand applause.
